        This was an amazing bootcamp conducted by Shape AI.The bootcamp was
        teken by Mr.Shaurya Sinha sir.He is a data analyst intern at JIO.I got
        hands on experience in it.In these 7 days we are learnt the very basics
        of javascript and reactjs from the scratch.Everyone can learn from this
        who don't have any knowledge from javascript.i enjoyed this bootcamp.
